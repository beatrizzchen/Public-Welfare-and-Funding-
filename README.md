Conducted a statistical and research project on the effects of government funding and satisfaction of public welfare programs for the course _GEEC20009.01, "Methods for Public Policy Analysis" at Fudan University,_ 2025.

This project led me to my research question _“Does a reduction in federal cuts in government-aided programs worsen the accessibility and quality of essential services?”,_ allowing me to delve into the intricacies of population welfare and the process of funding proposals, including state expenditure throughout the 50 states. Through my research, I hope to answer the need for services and aid that are reliant on federal funding, as well as understand how and where our taxpayer dollars are going instead.
